    /// ### Performance Notes
    ///
    /// In theory, parallel directory traversal can be significantly faster, and what's possible for our current
    /// `gix_features::fs::WalkDir` implementation is to abstract a `filter_entry()` method so it works both for
    /// the iterator from the `walkdir` crate as well as from `jwalk`. However, doing so as initial version
    /// has the risk of not being significantly harder if not impossible to implement as flow-control is very
    /// limited.
    ///
    /// Thus the decision was made to start out with something akin to the Git implementation, get all tests and
    /// baseline comparison to pass, and see if an iterator with just `filter_entry` would be capable of dealing with
    /// it. Note that `filter_entry` is the only just-in-time traversal control that `walkdir` offers, even though
    /// one could consider switching to `jwalk` and just use its single-threaded implementation if a unified interface
    /// is necessary to make this work - `jwalk` has a more powerful API for this to work.
    ///
    /// If that was the case, we are talking about 0.5s for single-threaded traversal (without doing any extra work)
    /// or 0.25s for optimal multi-threaded performance, all in the WebKit directory with 388k items to traverse.
    /// Thus, the speedup could easily be 2x or more and thus worth investigating in due time.
